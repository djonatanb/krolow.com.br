I was invited to talk at Academic Week of Computer at [IFSUL Pelotas](https://www.facebook.com/saspiifsul/photos/a.556946144405919.1073741828.501572353276632/559482464152287/?type=3), I was unsure what i'd i talk for guys that are starting as programmer, and for some of them that are about to join the market, so I decided to do a more soft skill talk about programmer career.

After show this presentation I had received two more invitations to talk about the same subject in others universities.
